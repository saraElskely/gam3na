“Gam3na” is a social platform aims to gather people with same hobbies and interests in one place to do what they love with other people who have the same interest.
Through “Gam3na” you get to uncover the best version of your self because you do the things that matter to you.
We provide you a partner/s to share the same interest or hobby with you when ever you want where ever you want.
You can learn, travel, play, teach, discover new things,expand your connections, and widen your horizons through our community.
Even if you are starting a new business like (Gym,Courses-center,café,bookstore….) not many people are visiting your place we can provide you with the traffic you need by recommending your venue to our people.   
Our idea based on two things:
Providing people with partners and activities that related to their interests.
Working  as a media channel to venues and providing them with traffic.
